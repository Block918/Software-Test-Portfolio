# Software-Test-Portfolio
  I ensure my code and program run functionally by testing them with inputs and checking the outputs, also checking the coverage of what was successfully tested and how much was not. User needs are very important and should all try to be incorporated into our software because the users are what makes our program successful. Approaching software design can be intimidating but a software design paper can be done first to kind of act as an overview of all our goals and requirements we are looking for out of the software we are creating. This would be my way of going about it so I kind of work through it making sure I implement everything needed.
